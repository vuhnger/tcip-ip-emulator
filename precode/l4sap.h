/* The design of the L4 layer is the following:
 *
 * The L4 layer provides a reliable datagram service using
 * the very simple stop-and-wait protocol. To be clear: this
 * means that only the sequence numbers 0 and 1 can be used
 * (even though the protocol header is a byte).
 *
 * The reliable datagram service should be full-duplex,
 * meaning that both the server and client can potentially
 * send packets at the same time. Due to the nature of the
 * stop-and-wait protocol, arriving packets may be discarded
 * if the receiving side is not ready.
 *
 * A client and a server do not negotiate a connection like
 * TCP, but unlike a UDP receiver, which can receive packets
 * from several UDP senders on the same IP address and UDP port,
 * this L4 server can only handle data from a single client,
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * This very simple L4 layer is meant to support exactly one
 * pair of client and server. Whem data arrives from an
 * unexpected source, it is allowed to misbehave in any way.
 *
 * If either client or server are terminated, the other one
 * is in an undefined state and should be restarted.
 *
 * When client or server received an L4_RESET message, they
 * quit.
 *
 * The specific design is yours.
